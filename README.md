**First Attempts - Visualisations**

This repository contains my early attempts at creating visualisations. Each folder represents a different platform or tool I am learning.

### 1. [Order Sales Dashboard Project](./order_sales_dashboard-project)
**Objective:** To enable data-driven decision-making through continuous monitoring of sales trends, anomalies, and revenue performance against historical baselines for Monthly and Quarterly reviews.
**Input:** Cleaned sales_transactions tables from Databricks.
**Method:** Visualisation with data aggregation, calculation of MoM/YoY growth metrics, and the development of interactive time-series and heatmap visualisations.
**Result:** An interactive Databricks Order Sales Dashboard tracking Net Revenue, Sales Quantity, and Regional performance.
